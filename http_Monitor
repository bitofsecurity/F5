## Request: 
GET http://www.somesite.com HTTP/1.0\r\nConnection:Close
## Response:
HTTP/1.. (200|301|302)
## Public Site Config:
## Interval: 30 sec
## Timeout: 31 sec
## Else you get blocked 
## Important: Use HTTP/1.0 that doesn't keep session open. It's cleaner for HTTP Monitoring. 
## Use 4 HTTP Monitors on your Pool and the pool config so that the nodes are marked up if 2 out of 5 is up. Create an ICMP monitor to monitor 
## your proxies, in that way you have at least 1 HTTP and 1 ICMP monitor enabled.
